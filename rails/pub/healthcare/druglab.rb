# Lab Equipment Controller Script
#
# This Ruby script simulates the control of laboratory equipment for the synthesis
# of various drugs including DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, Dexamphetamine, MDMA, and LSD.
# It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how software might interact
# with lab equipment in a controlled setting.
#
# Features:
# - Drug-Specific Procedures: Includes tailored recipes for the synthesis of specific substances.
# - Modular Design: Uses reusable and modular methods for easy modifications.
# - Safety and Compliance: Emphasizes the importance of safety checks and regulatory compliance.
#
# This script is purely for educational and illustrative purposes. Actual chemical syntheses
# involve complex safety and regulatory considerations and must be conducted by professionals.
#
# Usage:
# To run the script, ensure Ruby is installed and execute this file from the command line.
