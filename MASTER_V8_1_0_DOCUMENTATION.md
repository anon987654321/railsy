## Implementation Guide

### Installation

1. Place `master_v8_1_0.json` in your project root
2. Run validation: `ruby validate_master_v8_1_0.rb master_v8_1_0.json`
3. Configure your application to use the framework

### Configuration

The framework is self-configuring with intelligent defaults. Key configuration areas:

- **Constitutional Principles**: Customize principle precedence if needed
- **Memory Management**: Adjust compression ratios and hierarchy levels
- **Security Settings**: Configure pledge/unveil restrictions for your environment
- **Communication**: Set LLM detection preferences and formatting options

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Framework Integration

```ruby
require 'json'

framework = JSON.parse(File.read('master_v8_1_0.json'))
constitutional_engine = framework['constitutional_framework']['decision_engine']

# Apply constitutional principles to decision-making
decision = apply_constitutional_decision(user_request, constitutional_engine)
```

#### Memory Management

```ruby
memory_manager = framework['memory_management_sophistication']
context_hierarchy = memory_manager['hierarchical_context_management']

# Manage context with compression
compressed_context = apply_context_compression(
  current_context, 
  context_hierarchy['compression_ratio']
)
```

#### Security Integration

```ruby
security_framework = framework['safety_and_security_enhancement']
zero_trust = security_framework['zero_trust_model']

# Apply zero-trust validation
validated_request = zero_trust_validate(request, zero_trust)
```
