  The fifth time, they actually read the ad.
  The sixth time, they thumb their nose at it.
  The seventh time, they start to get a little irritated with it.
  The eighth time, they start to think, “Here's that confounded ad again.”
  The ninth time, they start to wonder if they're missing out on something.
  The tenth time, they ask their friends and neighbors if they've tried it.
  The eleventh time, they wonder how the company is paying for all these ads.
  The twelfth time, they start to think that it must be a good product.
  The thirteenth time, they start to feel the product has value.
  The fourteenth time, they start to remember wanting a product exactly like this.
  The fifteenth time, they start to yearn for it because they can't afford to buy it.
  The sixteenth time, they accept the fact that they will buy it sometime in the future.
  The seventeenth time, they make a note to buy the product.

Hi! I got this Rack middleware which uses regexes to minify HTML and inline JS: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/35cf4eb4e2f64e6f42a1a7ccbafcd248

But when it comes to inline JSON, however, I'm experiencing the following problems:

### Failed regex 1
`[/>\s+{/, ">{ "]`
Original: `>      {`
Should be: `>{`

### Failed regex 2
`[/}\s+>/, " }<"]`
Original: `}      <`
Should be: `}<`

### Failed regex 3
`[%r/{"/, '{ %r/"']`
Original: `{"`
Should be: `{ "`

### Failed regex 4
`[%r/"}/, '%r/" }']`
Original: `"}`
Should be: `" }`

### Failed regex 5
`[%r/",\s+/, ", "]`
Original: `,        "`
Should be: `, "`

## The goal is to turn this:
```
<script>      {"@context": "http://schema.org",        "@type": "WebSite"}    </script>
```

into:
```
<script>{ "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "WebSite" }</script>
```

Optimistic posting

  Right now it copies the previous post and replaces its content with what the user wrote in the new post form. Could this be simplified?

  Was unable to do instant IDs for likes and reply-to links. I could copy the ID from the previous post and just add +1, but then if someone else posts while I'm posting, we'd get dupe IDs. Hence, show this area as a grey rectancle while we fetch and add the correct IDs from server.
